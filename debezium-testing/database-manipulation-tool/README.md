# Database-manipulation-tool
Java quarkus application used for idempotent upsertion of a single entity into multiple different databases.
Main functionality is the upsert with table creation/alteration. You send a http request with JSON body (example below)
and the tables will be either created or altered (columns will be added to he table) so the schema corresponds with the JSON. Then it proceeds to either insert or update the row into all the databases.  
## Working features

This is currently in alpha state so there are not many features completed and the ones that are finished aren't tested properly.

| Database/feature        	       | Postgres 	 | Mongo 	 | Mysql 	 | Oracle 	 | SqlServer 	 | Db2 	 |
|---------------------------------|------------|---------|---------|----------|-------------|-------|
| Create table            	       | X    	     | X   	   | X   	   | 	        | 	           | 	     |
| Insert                  	       | X    	     | X	      | X   	   | 	        | 	           | 	     |
| Upsert and alter/create table 	 | X	         | X	      | X	      | 	        | 	           | 	     |
| Delete                  	       | 	          | 	       | 	       | 	        | 	           | 	     |
| Drop table        	             | X	         | X	      | X	      | 	        | 	           | 	     |
| Reset Database        	         | X	         | 	X      | X	      | 	        | 	           | 	     |

## Json insertion schema
```
{
	"databases": ["db2", "postgresql", "mysql", "mongo"],
	"table": "pepici",
	"primary": "name",
	"payload": [{
            "name": "name",
            "dataType": "VarChar(255)",
            "value": "PepaZDepa"
        },
        {
            "name": "age",
            "dataType": "Integer",
            "value": "20"
        }
    ]
}
```

It is imperative to use the primary key so that the created tables can have primary key and can be correctly updated.
Primary keys must always be unique and once set cannot be changed. Therefore, I recommend using GUID or other system that ensures these properties.

When Creating tables, the `payload` value determines the columns and their types.

You can enable/disable different databases with the `enabled` property. The database insertion filtering based on json key `databases` is not implemented yet. Every enabled database will try to execute the command.

You can reset all databases on DMT start with property `onstart.reset.database`.

## Current REST endpoints

<summary><code>POST</code> <code><b>/Main/Insert</b></code> <code>(Inserts json into all enabled databases)</code></summary>
<summary><code>POST</code> <code><b>/Main/CreateTable</b></code> <code>(Creates table/collection in every enabled database)</code></summary>
<summary><code>POST</code> <code><b>/Main/CreateTableAndUpsert</b></code> <code>(Upserts json into all databases and creates tables if they did not exist or adds columns so the json can be upserted)</code></summary>
<summary><code>DELETE</code> <code><b>/Main/DropTable</b></code> <code>(Drops table/collection in every enabled database)</code></summary>
<summary><code>DELETE</code> <code><b>/Main/ResetDatabase</b></code> <code>(Drops all databases/schemas and creates them again)</code></summary>

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/database-manipulation-tool-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.
